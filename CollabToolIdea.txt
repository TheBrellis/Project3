Further Together

Description: A tool/app for enterprise level organizations that will enable ease of collaboration, brainstorming, networking, mentoring internally amongst different development teams

Problem to Solve: Large organizations often have many separate teams/individuals that work in silos and may not be able to easily get help when needed.  
It would be ideal to have a place to go to be able to ask for help, collaboration, mentor, meetup etc. There is much unused/unshared talent.

Notes | 

Frontend:

    Login/User register

    Help wanted page:  
        This can be similar to a Stack Exchange for problems, asking for help/advice/input/collaboration.  Tags would be used for different categories to be able to filter if desired.
    
    Meetup/Outside opportunities
        Setup similar to a discussion feed, a place to talk about goings ons in the industry- can have a discussion board to ask questions or comment on. This would be a place to ask
        if anyone has interest in extracurricular development projects etc.

    Mentor outreach
        This may be too similar to the above to warrant a separate page.  
    
    Cheatsheet collection?
    
    Internal announcements
        ?

Backend:
    Tables needed:
        Login/User Tables
        Topics/Tags
        Discussions (no clue logistics of this. . .)
        Cheatsheets (with a tag IDs FK)


SideNote- Stack Overflow for business enterprises is $12/month per teammate.  My company has 600 developers.  That is over $86K a year.
